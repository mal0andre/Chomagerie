## 🚀 What is Chomagerie?

**Chomagerie** is a Fabric mod that automatically refills consumed item stacks using shulker boxes stored in your **inventory** or **ender chest**.

When a stack reaches **zero through normal gameplay**, it is instantly refilled — no GUI, no clicks, no interruptions.

The project also includes a **datapack providing custom crafting recipes**, designed to integrate cleanly with vanilla
gameplay.
